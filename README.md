# os-weighted-shorted-path
Data science project to extract geospatial data from OS Datahub, transform the data, and perform analysis to find the weighted shortest path between two points of interest using Dijkstra's algorithm.

OS Data Science tutorials, specifically the 'weighted-shortest-path' repo used as a starting point and inspiration (credits to the authors) and applied to different datasets and route calculations.
